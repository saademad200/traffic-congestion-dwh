# TRAFFIC FLOW DATA WAREHOUSE DESIGN - FOCUSED APPROACH

## BUSINESS PROBLEM - REFINED
Urban areas need to manage traffic flow efficiently to reduce congestion and improve safety. With limited resources for data transformation, we'll focus on the most critical aspects:
- Monitoring and analyzing traffic flow patterns
- Identifying and responding to congestion issues
- Tracking accidents and incidents that affect traffic
- Understanding environmental impacts on traffic conditions
- Managing traffic control infrastructure

## GRAIN FOR DATA MART
The grain will be "Traffic events and measurements at a specific location, on a specific date, at a specific time."

## MAJOR KPIs INVOLVED
1. Traffic Flow Metrics
   - Average Daily Traffic (ADT) by location category
   - Traffic Volume by Hour of Day (Hourly Distribution Pattern)
   - Day of Week Traffic Variation Index (weekday vs weekend patterns)

2. Congestion Metrics
   - Peak Hour Congestion Index by location category
   - Average Congestion Duration
   - Congestion Predictability Score (measure of how consistently congestion occurs)

3. Safety Metrics
   - Accident Rate per hour of day
   - Accident Severity Distribution
   - Vehicle Involvement Factor (average vehicles per accident)
   - Weather-Related Accident Percentage

4. Environmental Impact Metrics
   - Weather Condition Impact Factor on traffic flow
   - Road Condition Impact Factor on average speed
   - Seasonal Traffic Volume Variance

5. Enforcement Metrics
   - Speed Violation Frequency by vehicle type
   - Average Speed Excess
   - Violation Hotspot Index by location

## SELECTED OLTP TABLES (7 TOTAL)
1. TrafficFlow - PRIMARY - Essential for flow analysis

## DIMENSION MANAGEMENT APPROACH

### DIM_Location
- **Primary Source**: Multiple source tables (no overlap exists)
- **Snapshot Strategy**: Type 1 SCD since location is primarily a name/identifier
- **Coverage**: All unique locations from each source table
- **Note**: EDA revealed zero overlap between location values across different source tables. This means locations cannot be correlated across different event types without additional geocoding.

### DIM_Date
- **Type**: Standard date dimension (not derived from source systems)
- **Coverage**: Pre-populated for 5 years (3 years historical, current year, 1 year future)
- **Granularity**: Day level
- **Special Attributes**: Holidays, school days, special events that impact traffic
- **Updates**: Yearly to extend the future date range

### DIM_Time
- **Type**: Standard time dimension (not derived from source systems)
- **Coverage**: 24-hour clock with 1-minute intervals
- **Special Attributes**: Rush hour flags, day segments, typical traffic pattern periods
- **Updates**: Static, rarely changes

### DIM_Vehicle, DIM_EventType, DIM_Environmental
- **Update Frequency**: Weekly for Environmental, Monthly for the others
- **Historical Tracking**: Type 2 SCD for Environmental conditions, Type 1 for others

## NOTES ON LOCATION HANDLING

The exploratory data analysis revealed a critical insight: there is **zero overlap (0.0%)** between location values across different source tables. This means:

1. **No unified location dimension is possible** without additional data enrichment
2. **Cross-domain location analysis** (e.g., accident rates at congested intersections) will not be possible with current data

These analytical capabilities directly support urban traffic planning, public safety enhancement, and infrastructure optimization goals, though with the noted limitations in location correlation.
